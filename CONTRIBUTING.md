# How to Contributing?

There is no mystery - It's simple, really! Don't be afraid.

1. Clone two repositories: Frontend and Backend, and run then in your machine.
2. Check our roadmap and pick one card (just one card at time).
3. Write some code... (That is the best part)
4. Push your code to new branch (check branch name pattern bellow)
5. Open a PR and cross your fingers. ðŸ¤ž


Easy peasy lemon squeezy, right?!


You can also contributing with documentation (for API), new issues, layouts and some ideas.
